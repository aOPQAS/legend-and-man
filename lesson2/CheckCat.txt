Programming is fucking awesome when you google stuff and accidentally make something work.
Everyone starts from scratch, scratching their heads, trying to figure out where the hell the curly brackets are missing. Errors?
It’s not a failure, it’s just a damn ritual everyone goes through.
Be ready: sometimes the code doesn’t work because it’s "not in the mood."
But don’t worry, you’ll dig through that fucking Stack Overflow or search on Google, and — bam! — it works, motherfucker.
